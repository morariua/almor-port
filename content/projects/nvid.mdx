## Overview 

The NVIDIA Stock Predictor project is an exploration of various machine learning models applied to the task of predicting NVIDIA stock prices. This project aims to evaluate and compare the accuracy and performance of different approaches, including:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **K-Means and Data Cleaning Techniques

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to determine which machine learning technique provides the most accurate predictions for NVIDIA stock prices over time. The models are evaluated using historical stock data, and their results are compared based on accuracy, computational efficiency, and robustness.

## Key Features
- Implementation of multiple machine learning algorithms for stock price prediction.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing, feature engineering, and analysis.
- Performance metrics to compare models effectively.
